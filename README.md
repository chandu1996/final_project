FOOD DELIVERY SYSTEM USING B2B2C MODEL

Food Delivery System using B2B2C Model aims to provide a hassle free platform for selling different kinds of food items provided by different food hubs.
Since there are many good food hubs in almost every city or town providing there services among a lot of people, many of them are doing really well and expanding their business at exponential rate since they have fund for doing so, but those who lacks infrastructural, financial, economical facilities are lying much behind in the race.
These dominated group of shops need a reliable, robust, efficient, technically sound platform which will enable them to cope up in the market shared by economically sound vendors.
 In the present scenario the people are very busy in their day-to-day life, that they even donâ€™t have time to cook food for them. As we know that India is very involved in software industry and majority of people live away from home and food is something for which they have to compromise and they are very involved in their hectic schedule that to have proper food in the proper time is not in their fortune. Resulting they go for online food services which are performing really good in the food service market because of financial support but they are not in touch with those food hubs which provide good, delicious, hygienic, fresh and less priced food.
So this brings the need of a platform through which they can get freshly cooked food at their door step and help to grow the business of small food hubs providing better services at lesser cost.
This software will also provide an opportunity to the food-hub owners to make available their food items to a large number of food connoisseur.
